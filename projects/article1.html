<p>Cloud computing is transforming how businesses manage data, applications, and infrastructure. Services like **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud** allow companies to scale globally while reducing operational costs.</p>

<p>One of the key advancements in cloud computing is **serverless computing**, which removes the need for server management. Instead of renting entire servers, businesses can use **on-demand execution**, reducing costs and improving efficiency.</p>

<p>Another trend is the rise of **multi-cloud strategies**, where businesses use multiple cloud providers to avoid dependency on a single vendor. This improves **security, reliability, and compliance** with global regulations.</p>

<p>As cloud adoption continues to rise, companies must focus on **security, cost management, and automation** to stay ahead of the competition.</p>
